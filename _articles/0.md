If you've spent enough time online reading the news or scrolling on Twitter, you may have heard by now that over *half* of *all* marriages in the United States end in divorce.

That's obviously a very worrying amount. If you have a >50% chance of divorcing, what point is there in getting married? And if you're the breadwinner, you have lots to lose by marrying someone who makes much less than you. Even if you marry someone making the same, the custodial battle and heartbreak will make the whole affair a nightmare to go through. So much for love.

But what if I told you that just by reading this article and worrying about divorce, you actually have a far better chance of a successful marriage than the stats imply? In fact, the stats are so misleading that it borders on total misinformation, if not an outright lie.

Let's narrow point by point. Let's start with the initial claim:

## Over half of *all* marriages fail

Let's look at that more closely. Over half of *all* marriages fail? So, which ones are failing?

Well, we would expect that second, third, etc. marriages fail at much higher rates. And they do! Unfortunately, second marriages fail at a much higher rate: [you can naively expect a 46% chance of divorce, separation, or death at ten years](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/key_statistics/d.htm#divorce) versus a 32-36% chance for first marriages.

Of course this makes sense: people who divorce are less likely to be able to hold a marriage, let alone people who divorce and remarry more than once.

Unfortunately, there is still not much good news so far, as ~50% of first marriages still fail by 20 years of marriage according to these statistics.

But that's ok! We're not done yet. Let's revise our claim:

## Half of *all* first-time marriages fail

That word, 'all'. What a curious word. Maybe we should look at what the reasons are for divorce?

The most common, standing at 75%, is "lack of commitment" (unclear what is meant by this). 

But looking closer at other reasons, **24%** cited domestic violence as a reason, **34%** cited substance abuse, and **59%** cited infidelity.

I've been beating around the bush on this one, but men show a lot more anxiety about divorce than women do. Following these statistics, men happen to commit these acts much more frequently than women (except infidelity, which is either [about as likely to be committed by men](https://ifstudies.org/blog/who-cheats-more-the-demographics-of-cheating-in-america) or much more likely the older the man is).

So, if you don't plan on abusing drugs or alcohol, abusing your spouse, or cheating on your spouse, your chances of divorce just decreased drastically as a man. And if you are a woman, you can at least significantly reduce your chances by not cheating.

By *how much* the chance reduces is unclear due to the overlap of these issues, but hey, I didn't promise any hard and irrefutable numbers on your chances in this article (and, as I'll show later, it's impossible for me to do so).

So now, let's revise our claim further:

## < Half of *all* first-time marriages without abuse, cheating, or substance abuse fail

Don't worry, the amount of qualifications on the statistic will continue to rise.

Let's revisit that study covering reasons for divorce. I will note one more major reason for divorce: financial problems, cited by 36% of divorcees. How much does that really contribute?

We'll cover income, education, and intelligence. I lump all three together since they are all correlated with each other.

The percentage of divorcees in the married-at-least-once population [levels off significantly](https://flowingdata.com/2021/05/04/divorce-rates-and-income/) as you approach $200,000 of household income. Past that, the data is a bit noisy and fluctuates like a sine wave:

Overall, it drops from ~40-45% with <20k in income to a mere 25-30% at the trough (around $200-500k).

Similarly, college education of the wife [significantly reduces](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr049.pdf) the chances of divorce, contrary to the claims of some people. 

According to the linked paper (see Table 5), the chance of divorce after 20 years of marriage for women with bachelor's degrees is **only 22%** as compared to **61%** for high school dropouts, **59%** for high school graduates, and **51%** for college dropouts.

In other words, if you marry a college-educated woman (or *are* one), your naive chance of divorce is automatically *less than half* of the originally-claimed chances.

And if that wasn't enough, more intelligent couples are much more likely to stay together. In a study from Finland, over five years **82%** of men with the lowest intelligence score who got married at 26-30 stayed married, whereas **94%** of men with the highest intelligence scores stayed married. In other words, the chance of divorcing over five years was **over 50% less** for the most intelligent men versus the least intelligent (as measured by IQ).

Of course, all of these are correlated, and I expect education at least is highly anti-correlated with substance abuse, domestic violence, and probably even infidelity. But if you check all the right boxes, your chances just decreased drastically regardless (by *more than half* and likely much more).

So now, let's revise our statements further:

## < 25% of *all* first-time marriages without abuse, cheating, or substance abuse, where one/both spouses are educated, smart, and have a high income fail

Wow, okay, that's a bit too many qualifications.

But you see my point, right? If you happen to fulfill all of these conditions, your chances are so different from the general population that the naive stats become useless to even consider. Many people who get married had no business getting married in the first place! If you're even worried about divorcing, chances are you are *not* part of that population.

And it should be obvious, right? Think of all the stereotypes of a failed marriage: financial issues, screaming, abuse, alcoholism, cheating... anyone could have told you that all of these are significant factors for divorces before you even read this article. Chances are that very few of you will run into these issues.

Of course, I'm not saying that you have a 0% chance of divorcing even if your marriage ticks all of the right boxes. People change, love fades, sometimes sh\*t happens and it's nobody's fault in particular. 

But the chances of failure sure as hell aren't *50%*.

So why do people think they have a high chance of divorce even if they fall into none of the pits typical divorcees do? I suspect some people have a few horror stories in mind and extrapolate it to themselves, ignoring the underlying context of such divorces.

But I think mostly, this is just horrible reasoning. People love to apply general population statistics to themselves, but averages are extremely bad to apply to yourself.

Think of it like this: if you wanted to know *your* chances of dying in a wildfire, would you look up how many people die in a wildfire and divide it by the US population? 

Or, would you consider first whether you live in a heavily wooded area to begin with? 

If you don't, your chances are near zero. If you *do*, your chances just increased drastically (even if they are still relatively small). 

The average will never capture the real chances in either scenario. An abusive, cheating alcoholic on his third marriage should not expect merely a 50% chance of divorce or separation. 

Nor should a non-abusive, educated man with a stable job a rate as high as 50%.

That said, even this article is insufficient and will always be. The best we can do is find correlations between certain characteristics and divorce rates. 

Assessing *your own* chances is still going to depend heavily on who you marry. If you marry someone who you have nothing in common with even if you both check all the right boxes in the abstract, you may have a divorce coming at you quickly.

So, you can ignore general population statistics for your own decision-making, but I hope this article gives you a clearer picture of your chance of divorce.


And in the future, whenever you see these kinds of stats, always ask yourself this:

**"What *kind* of person would fall into this situation?"** Adjust your expectations accordingly.
